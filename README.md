You might also be looking for [💬 chat logs for SRCDS based
games](https://github.com/crescentrose/chat-log), a handful of TF2 plugins I contributed to
([🔀 `tf2-scrimblo`](https://github.com/crescentrose/tf2-scrimblo), [🎗️
`uncletopia-nags`](https://github.com/crescentrose/uncletopia-nags), [🗺️ Uncletopia Map
Chooser](https://github.com/crescentrose/UMC)) or the [🎮 SourceMod plugin
template](https://github.com/crescentrose/sourcemod-template). However, those are mostly
unmaintained and might now work with recent game versions. Please use something else!
